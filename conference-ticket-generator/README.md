## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Actually, I learned a lot while building this website using plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
- I learned how to do a drag and drop file uploading.
- I learned how to make a background for the website that consists of different svg files.
- I learned to handle errors during submitting a form.
- I learned to populate the form data inside a another web page.

**I believe in Practice makes Perfect. I learned a lot and I am very ecstatic that I got out of the tutorial hell.
